Friend Connections: Users can send and accept friend requests, and maintain a list of their friends. Messaging: The program does not include a direct messaging feature, but notifications can be used to simulate messaging functionality. Notifications: Users receive notifications for friend requests, new posts from friends, and other activities. News Feed: Users can retrieve a news feed of the latest posts from their friends, sorted by timestamp. Multimedia Sharing: The program does not include multimedia sharing functionality, but it can be extended to support it.

Content Recommendations: The program simulates content recommendations by randomly selecting a post from the user's feed and displaying it. Privacy Settings: Users can set privacy settings for their profile and posts. Technical Approach: The social networking site will be developed using Python as the primary programming language. The project will leverage various Python libraries and frameworks to implement the necessary functionality, such as: Flask or Django for the web application framework SQLAlchemy or PyMongo for database management WebSockets or Socket.IO for real-time updates Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for content recommendations The project will also incorporate best practices in software engineering, such as modular design, object-oriented programming, and test-driven development to ensure maintainability and scalability. Target Audience: The ConnectHub social networking site is designed to serve a wide range of users, from individuals looking to connect with friends and share their experiences to communities and organizations seeking to build and engage their audience. Expected Outcomes: By the end of the project, the ConnectHub social networking site will provide users with a comprehensive and engaging platform for social interactions, content sharing, and community building.
